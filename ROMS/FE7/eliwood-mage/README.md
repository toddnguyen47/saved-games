This is a Fire Emblem 7 - Blazing Swords hack where Eliwood is a mage (promoted to a Mage Knight), along with some minor tweaks.

## Character Changes

**Eliwood**
* Now a mage!

Unpromoted:
* He will start with D rank in Anima and Dark magic in his unpromoted state.
* Yes, he has Micaiah's animations. I love Micaiah so... here she is.
* Will start with an additional +1 MAG (class base stat) since he no longer has Sword advantage

Promoted:
* When promoted, he will gain D rank to Light and D rank in Staves.
* Essentially, Eliwood will be able to use all 3 magic types + staves.

**Wil**
* I feel bad for archers. Let's face it, they suck. Adding some base stats so hopefully archers can be more relevant.

|                 |                  |
| --------------- | ---------------- |
| HP: 2 &rarr; 3  | DEF: N/A         |

## Item Changes

**Rapier**
* Converted to a Dark tome. Renamed to "Dulamier" to match the spell animation ("Dulam") + end of Rapier
* Still has effectiveness against infantry

**Durandal**
* Converted to a Dark tome.
* Still is effective against dragons

**ThunderStf**
* New item! It is an unlimited usage of a weapon (it's a tome, but it won't give any experience)
* USES UNLIMITED / POW 2 / HIT 90 / WT 2 / CRIT 0 / RANGE 1-2

**Wind Dagger**
* New item! Sword's equivalent of Javelin / Hand Axe. Can be used as a range weapon
* USES 20 / POW 4 / HIT 75 / WT 7 / CRIT 0 / RANGE 1-2
* Will be sold in shops that sell Javelins and Hand Axes
